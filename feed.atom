Life is filled with a series of small decisions, some of which can have an outsized impact.</blockquote><blockquote>When I set out to write a novel, it was not after a major decision. It was a mere inevitability. But once I began, the first shock was how many decisions I had to make. Should the narration be in first person, what should be the voice, should the lead character do this or that, should bad things happen to the main character, should it all be happy and well? All minor decisions, by the standards of decisions, but some of them turned out to be crucial, not only to a page or the tone or the novel, but to my life.</blockquote><blockquote>The most harmful thing about a successful person is that he begins to emit advice. Stripped of all the frills, the advice industry has one common theme: a person saying, ‘Why can’t you be like me?’ Experts advise on decision-making itself.</blockquote>]]></content>

Yet there is also talk of a workplace hangover, a phase when disillusionment sets in as one grasps the actual mechanics of the organisation. One potential explanation for this dynamic could be hedonic adaptation; we become accustomed to positive changes over time. Consequently, no matter how appealing a new role might initially seem, we eventually habituate to it.</blockquote>]]></content>

In the world of education, we call this lightening the cognitive load. Making your own contribution at the outset lets a kid get a feel for what you’re all about, while also supplying specific content for them to respond to.</blockquote><blockquote>= Instead of “How do you like school?” tell them in a sentence or two about a silly teacher you had, a surprising playground incident you witnessed, or a kid you knew who could do a cool trick. </blockquote><blockquote>= Instead of “What do you want to be when you grow up?” tell them what you wanted to be when you grew up, and maybe what your friends wanted to be, too.</blockquote><blockquote>Another way to lighten the load on kids is to ask what amounts to a multiple choice question. Multiple choice questions are common on tests and surveys of all kinds because they require less effort, so people are more likely to answer them. This format is also nice because it gives you an opportunity to throw in a silly option.</blockquote><blockquote>= Instead of “Did you have fun at gymnastics?” try “Did you love gymnastics today or hate it?” or “Which do you like better, gymnastics or drawing? Or sitting silently in the dark doing nothing?” </blockquote><blockquote>= Instead of “What’s your favorite food?” you could ask, “Which food do you like best: pizza, ramen, or fish guts?” </blockquote><blockquote>One of the most successful conversation gambits with kids, I’ve found, is to actually not expect them to respond at all. Just lob one or two kid-friendly observations in their direction and see what happens.</blockquote><blockquote>“On my way here I saw a tractor with the most gigantic tires I have ever seen! They were bigger than my car! I was like, ‘whaaaat????’”</blockquote><blockquote>= “Look at that, we both have boots. But yours have stripes and mine have no stripes. No fair! I want stripes on my boots! Maybe we should trade.”</blockquote><blockquote>= “I see you’ve got a Pokémon binder there. Believe it or not, I know nothing about Pokémon! The only one I can even name is Pikachu!”</blockquote>]]></content>

This creates what Ira Glass famously called "the gap," but I think of it as the thing that separates creators from consumers.</blockquote><blockquote>This resonated quite strongly with me. It puts into words something that I've been feeling when working with AI. If you're new to something and using AI for it, it automatically boosts the floor of your taste, but not your skill. And you end up never slowing down to make mistakes and learn, because you can just do it without friction.</blockquote>]]></content>

But what they mean is they watched a 30-second TikTok or skimmed a headline while scrolling through their feed. They think they've "read" something when they've consumed the intellectual equivalent of cotton candy: all sugar, no substance, dissolving the moment it hits their tongue. They're gorging themselves on clickbait headlines designed to trigger, not inform… each one a perfect little lie that promises understanding while delivering only the emotional rush of feeling informed.</blockquote><blockquote>I think this can be worse than ignorance. It's the illusion of knowledge coupled with the confidence that comes from thinking you understand something you've never actually encountered. These people walk around armed with headlines masquerading as insights, ready to deploy half-digested talking points in conversations that require actual thought. They've become human echo chambers, amplifying signals they never bothered to decode.</blockquote>]]></content>

People who were chronically late, missed meetings, or failed to manage their time would see TikToks about “time blindness” as if it was a medical condition, and self-diagnose as having that.</blockquote><blockquote>It was bizarre to suddenly have people missing scheduled events and then casually informing me that they had time blindness, as if that made it okay. Once they had a label for a condition, they felt like they had a license to escape accountability.</blockquote><blockquote>The most frustrating part was that the people who self-diagnosed as having “time blindness” universally got worse at being on time. Once they had transformed the personal problem into a labeled condition, they didn’t feel as obligated to do anything about it.</blockquote>]]></content>

You are reliable, efficient, maybe even indispensable in the short term. But you are seen primarily as a gap-filler, someone who delivers on tasks that have to be done but are not necessarily a core component of the company strategy. “Take care of that and don’t screw up” is your mission, and the fewer headaches you create for your leadership chain, the bigger the rewards.    </blockquote><blockquote>Being valued, on the other hand, means that you are brought into more conversations, not just to execute, but to help shape the direction.

Permission to not to those forced office engagement activities. Hell....</p><blockquote>A lens I started looking at the social world through a while back is permission. Specifically, that everybody is looking for it, and that many situations, relationships, and activities can be thought of in terms of what permission they give you.</blockquote><blockquote>A common, practical, example of this is asking stupid questions in meetings: Often everybody is confused, but nobody feels they have permission to ask, so once somebody is prepared to break the silence everyone is more able to (although a friend has expressed concern that asking stupid questions has instead become high status as people have learned this).</blockquote><blockquote>I think a lot of circumstances end up implicitly granting permission by making the action “playing the game”. For example, people behave very differently when drunk, but a lot of this isn’t actually because alcohol, it’s because the fact that you’re drunk gives you permission to behave like a drunk person. You see this with things like stag parties, hen does, etc. where people are given permission by the format to behave like complete asses in ways they normally wouldn’t do.</blockquote><blockquote>I think this is also why a lot of “mandatory fun” fails: There is a certain sort of permission that you need to behave like a person in a fun situation, and often mandatory fun skips the “foreplay” element that is needed to provide that permission, so people end up in a situation where people are being expected to behave in a way that they do not feel they have permission to.</blockquote>]]></content>

I have read only 40 percent of the book, and I have already three pages worth of quotes. That's the real problem with Backman, he can be either too relatable or too insightful or both. The book has a similar quirky style as of Anxious People, so I am still waiting for the second half of book, which I believe, would give payoff for all the buildup. </p><p>Here are some of the quotes from it, especially the humorous and short ones, otherwise the book is bit too serious:</p><blockquote>= The cat just looks very annoyed, as if Louisa has spilled milk over its stamp collection.</blockquote><blockquote>= She offers the pack to the man, and he takes one, very hesitantly. Louisa can't help thinking that's   a kind thing to do, taking the risk to getting lung cancer out of sheer politeness.</blockquote><blockquote>= Whenever Joar left a room, it felt as if twenty people had walked out.</blockquote><blockquote>= Nothing weighs more than someone else's belief in you.</blockquote><blockquote>= "Meet" is probably the wrong word, no one met Joar, because you don't "meet" a natural disaster, you get hit by it.</blockquote><blockquote>= The cat knows that people will like the man more when they find out he's a world-famous artist, but they'll like the cat less when they find out it isn't homeless. We want to look up to men, but we'd prefer to feel sorry for cats, that's how the world works.</blockquote><blockquote>= When the soul of (our loved ones) leaves the body, evidently the last thing it does is tie our shoelaces together . In the weeks following the death, we trip over thin air.</blockquote>]]></content>

The first: most niches are local, and that isn’t where people look.</blockquote><blockquote>When I grew up, everybody was talking about “globalization,” which always seemed to be about how we can get Tamagotchis from Shanghai to Scranton in 24 hours or whatever. Maybe I missed this because I was, like, eight, but I don’t remember anyone mentioning the globalization of attention. We can move electrons even faster than we can move Tamagotchis, and the result is that everyone from Shanghai to Scranton is largely looking at, listening to, and talking about the same things. You can see this in the demise of local news, the consolidation of the internet, and all other forms of oligopoly.</blockquote><blockquote>The globalization of attention is a damn shame for many reasons, and the biggest is that it leaves lots of local niches neglected. If everyone’s trying to be an Instagram relationship advice influencer, nobody’s trying to be their friendly neighborhood Breakup Whisperer. Plus, everybody, no matter how much of a nobody they are, has at least a few people who are counting on them, whose lives they can ruin or enrich, and it’s hard to do much enriching when you’re fretting full-time about who’s gonna be the next president.</blockquote><blockquote>Local niches are important because they can pack a lot of meaning into a tiny space; they make it so that more people can matter. When I was thirteen, I got promoted to moderator of the “Flaming Chickens” forum of a Yu-Gi-Oh! message board, which is where people were allowed to “flame” things that they hated (stepdads, math class, low-quality English dubs of Yu-Gi-Oh! episodes). I was so excited because it meant I meant something. Was the job pointless? Yes. Was it not a “job” at all in the sense that it paid nothing? Yes. Did the forum eventually die because of an infidelity scandal inside the polycule of people who ran the message board? Also yes. But for a bit, I fit.</blockquote>]]></content>

So I've copied almost all of it here. I have observed this 'burnout' with me and my friends, but wasn't able to put it into words. This is exactly what I had in my mind.</p><blockquote>“It’s not enough to be busy; so are the ants. The question is: What are we busy about?” — Henry David Thoreau</blockquote><blockquote>If burnout was a natural byproduct of working too much (or too hard, or for too many hours), we’d see every founder/C-level suffering from it. And yet… they’re generally doing just fine; ICs and middle managers, on the other hand, are usually taking the biggest hit.</blockquote><blockquote>Preventing burnout from happening on our teams means that first we need to identify the real causes of it, otherwise we’re just sending people to long vacations hoping the problem fixes itself. (It won’t.)</blockquote><blockquote>Each case is different (of course), but from what I’ve seen with engineering teams over time, burnout usually isn’t about work’s volume—it’s about a lack of purpose or agency.</blockquote><blockquote>If an engineer can’t see how their hard work supports the company’s objectives, helps real users, or improves their own skill set, every hour feels heavier—pointless, even. And when people feel they have no input into what they do, that their tasks are simply “assigned” to them rather than chosen, any form of intrinsic motivation goes to the toilet.</blockquote><blockquote>Let me be clear: working too hard/for too long can obviously lead to burnout, but again, more often than not the entire story doesn’t end there. In many cases, burnout emerges when smart, passionate individuals find themselves working on tasks that feel meaningless or misaligned with their strengths and interests. They might be coding late into the night, but the real energy drain is when they ask themselves: Why am I doing this?</blockquote><blockquote>“Ok, I’m sold. What can I do about it?”</blockquote><blockquote>You can start by considering whether the people on your team:</blockquote><blockquote>Have control over the projects they work on;</blockquote><blockquote>Feel connected to the outcomes they produce;</blockquote><blockquote>Understand why their contributions matter;</blockquote>]]></content>

You ask to speak to someone who can do something about it, but you’re told that’s not company policy.</blockquote><blockquote>The unsettling thing about this conversation is that you progressively realise that the human being you are speaking to is only allowed to follow a set of processes and rules that pass on decisions made at a higher level of the corporate hierarchy. It’s often a frustrating experience; you want to get angry, but you can’t really blame the person you’re talking to. Somehow, the airline has constructed a state of affairs where it can speak to you with the anonymous voice of an amorphous corporation, but you have to talk back to it as if it were a person like yourself.</blockquote><blockquote>Bad people react to this by getting angry at the gate attendant; good people walk away stewing with thwarted rage.</blockquote>]]></content>

It depends on the complexity of the new feature, and the extendibility of the codebase. You have to use your best judgment. If it seems like a feature requires significant changes to existing modules, I’d lean on traditional development. However, if you see a gentle path to implementing this new feature, you might reap more benefits with TDD.</blockquote><blockquote>Greenfield development is a big no-no for TDD (at first). I don’t care how confident you are in what your interfaces will be. You’re not that good. Everything you think you know will change in the exploratory phase of a new project as you code, and you’ll strain your sanity by rewriting tests over and over again.

Your #1 job is pleasing the customer, as quickly, and as reliably, as possible.</blockquote><blockquote>2. Library code -- Slow changing, highly specified code. You have a long, conservative development cycle. Your #1 job is supporting application programmers.</blockquote><blockquote>TDD probably works for #2, less so for #1. Furthermore, we all dream of being library developers (that our code and specifications are stable, and that our code can last decades). Alas, most of us are Application developers, and the lifespan of our code isn't really that long.</blockquote><blockquote>Recognizing the lifespan of your code, as well as the innate goals of your team (quick and dirty application style, or slow and careful library style) is important.
</blockquote><blockquote>...[Another comment with: A counterpoint to above.]...

I think this distinction is harmful. Your application code should include areas that function as "library code." We do this at work with an explicit UI library that we package separately, but there's no reason it needs to be packaged separately, just create directories that represent some library-esque element of your application and heavily test it and write docs for it, like you would a library.</blockquote>]]></content>

Most people think of a story as some stuff happened over the course of time and now I'm going to tell you about that usually chronologically and that will amount to a story and that really is just reporting on your life and no one actually wants you to report on your life. You know, other than maybe your mother and your spouse might be required to listen. It's just a simple accounting of your day or your week or your month and that's not interesting and it's not a story. So a story is about change over time. Usually it's sort of a realization like - I used to think one thing and now I think another thing  - that's story. Most stories are transformational, meaning I once was one kind of person then some stuff happened and now I'm actually an authentically different kind of person.</blockquote><p>The surprising boom of nose jobs in Iran.</p><blockquote>All of the women in Iranian model Azadeh's family have had nose surgeries, each feeling the pressure to conform with Western beauty standards in a country where female bodies are heavily policed.</blockquote><blockquote>To Ms. Azadeh, smoothing out the bump in what Iranians would call the "Persian nose" she was born with proved a lucrative investment.</blockquote><blockquote>Since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iranian women have been required to dress modestly and cover their hair, and the beauty industry has become almost entirely centred on the face.</blockquote><blockquote>"After the operation, not only have I earned myself a modelling job with better social standing but I'm also earning three times more and I'm more respected by clients," she said.</blockquote>]]></content>

Can I call it Airbnb-fication of faces.</p><blockquote>In December 2019 the journalist Jia T. set about investigating a troubling trend. Many celebrities and influencers had started to resemble each other. </blockquote><blockquote>“This past summer, I booked a plane ticket to Los Angeles with the hope of investigating what seems likely to be one of the oddest legacies of our rapidly expiring decade: the gradual emergence, among professionally beautiful women, of a single, cyborgian face. It’s a young face, of course, with poreless skin and plump, high cheekbones. It has catlike eyes and long, cartoonish lashes; it has a small, neat nose and full, lush lips. It looks at you coyly but blankly, as if its owner has taken half a Klonopin and is considering asking you for a private-jet ride to Coachella.”</blockquote><blockquote>The look that Tolentino is describing is the result of (at least) three conspiring trends. The growing market for injectable treatments is driving a trend for physical enhancements. The rise of apps such as FaceTune is driving a trend for digital enhancements. And make-up techniques such as “strobing” and “contouring” are driving a trend for cosmetic enhancements. Over the last decade, these trends have developed in parallel, each feeding and fueling the other.</blockquote>]]></content>

This time about taking offbeat decisions.</p><blockquote>I guess what I’m saying is: everybody tells you to be yourself, but nobody tells you it’ll make you feel insane.</blockquote><blockquote>Maybe there are some lucky folks out there who are living Lowest Common Denominators, whose desires just magically line up with everything that is popular and socially acceptable, who would be happy living a life that could be approved by committee. But almost everyone is at least a little bit weird, and most people are very weird. If you’ve got even an ounce of strange inside you, at some point the right decision for you is not going to be the sensible one. You’re going to have to do something inadvisable, something alienating and illegible, something that makes your friends snicker and your mom complain. There will be a decision tucked behind glass that’s marked “ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS?”, and you’ll have to shatter it with your elbow and reach through.</blockquote>]]></content>

I wish I could see a way out of the endless hype cycles that continue to elicit little more than cynicism from me. The version of technology that we’re mostly being sold today has almost nothing to do with improving lives, but instead stuffing the pockets of those who already need for nothing. It’s not making us smarter. It’s not helping heal a damaged planet. It’s not making us happier or more generous towards each other. And it’s entrenched in everything — meaning a momentous challenge to re-wire or meticulously disconnect. I’m slowly finding my own ways of breaking free to regain a sense of self and purpose. I’ve felt adrift the last few weeks and hopefully some planned activities this weekend will help guide me back to shore. I also tend to be a bit morose around my birthday so it might just be that.</blockquote>]]></content>

It’s hard to really relax and enjoy the present moment if we’re worried about getting our basic needs met. But there’s no sense in spending one’s entire life preparing and strategizing at the expense of actually living any of it. So obviously the solution is to cycle between the two phases, inhale and exhale, yin and yang. </blockquote>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>AI and bagels!</h2><p>Source: <a href="https://desystemize.substack.com/p/if-youre-so-smart-why-cant-you-die?publication">desystemize.substack.com</a></p><p>Tags: tech</p><p>Colin has an interesting perspective on when and how intelligence in AI can be defined.</p><blockquote>When a coffee shop makes a bagel, it’s a pretty good bet they can make a croissant as well. Not every shop that has one has the other, but they’re pretty strongly correlated. We call this correlation “baking”.

This sounds like a weird way to say it. We call “this correlation” baking? It just…is baking, isn’t it? But the steps you follow aren’t literally the exact same. The procedure to make a bagel and the procedure to make a croissant happen to be similar enough, achieving similar enough ends, of interest to similar enough people, that those similarities can be compactly described by the one word “baking”. But there’s nothing special about the word “baking” uniting these on any fundamental level. The similarities came first, and the word after.

Now imagine a coffee shop that’s been tasked to “achieve superbaking”. They make one bagel on Monday, ten bagels on Tuesday, and eighty million bagels on Wednesday. They’ve never made a croissant. Have they achieved superbaking?    </blockquote><p>Now comparing it with 'intelligence' in AI.</p><blockquote>What I’m contending here is that the word “intelligence” is like the word “baking” and it’s long past time we actually sit down and sort the bagels from the croissants. I am strongly against arguments of the form “Oh, it’s just parroting the data set - it’s not really thinking.” AI does a lot of things that we call “thinking” when we do them slower and worse. The fact it can also do those things should make us humble and curious, not proud and dismissive. But I think it’s equally silly to lump all these capacities together into “intelligence” and say “Intelligence is going up, so soon it will do everything intelligence can do.” You need to see some croissants before you conclude it’s actually baking and not just bageling.</blockquote>]]></content>
