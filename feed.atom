So I've copied almost all of it here. I have observed this 'burnout' with me and my friends, but wasn't able to put it into words. This is exactly what I had in my mind.</p><blockquote>“It’s not enough to be busy; so are the ants. The question is: What are we busy about?” — Henry David Thoreau</blockquote><blockquote>If burnout was a natural byproduct of working too much (or too hard, or for too many hours), we’d see every founder/C-level suffering from it. And yet… they’re generally doing just fine; ICs and middle managers, on the other hand, are usually taking the biggest hit.</blockquote><blockquote>Preventing burnout from happening on our teams means that first we need to identify the real causes of it, otherwise we’re just sending people to long vacations hoping the problem fixes itself. (It won’t.)</blockquote><blockquote>Each case is different (of course), but from what I’ve seen with engineering teams over time, burnout usually isn’t about work’s volume—it’s about a lack of purpose or agency.</blockquote><blockquote>If an engineer can’t see how their hard work supports the company’s objectives, helps real users, or improves their own skill set, every hour feels heavier—pointless, even. And when people feel they have no input into what they do, that their tasks are simply “assigned” to them rather than chosen, any form of intrinsic motivation goes to the toilet.</blockquote><blockquote>Let me be clear: working too hard/for too long can obviously lead to burnout, but again, more often than not the entire story doesn’t end there. In many cases, burnout emerges when smart, passionate individuals find themselves working on tasks that feel meaningless or misaligned with their strengths and interests. They might be coding late into the night, but the real energy drain is when they ask themselves: Why am I doing this?</blockquote><blockquote>“Ok, I’m sold. What can I do about it?”</blockquote><blockquote>You can start by considering whether the people on your team:</blockquote><blockquote>Have control over the projects they work on;</blockquote><blockquote>Feel connected to the outcomes they produce;</blockquote><blockquote>Understand why their contributions matter;</blockquote>]]></content>

Activities that were once carefree become regulated and serious, as illustrated by experiences with K'Nex catapults and sparklers.</blockquote>]]></content>

You start to complain and point out how much you paid for your ticket, but you’re brought up short by the undeniable fact that the gate attendant can’t do anything about it. You ask to speak to someone who can do something about it, but you’re told that’s not company policy.</blockquote><blockquote>The unsettling thing about this conversation is that you progressively realise that the human being you are speaking to is only allowed to follow a set of processes and rules that pass on decisions made at a higher level of the corporate hierarchy. It’s often a frustrating experience; you want to get angry, but you can’t really blame the person you’re talking to. Somehow, the airline has constructed a state of affairs where it can speak to you with the anonymous voice of an amorphous corporation, but you have to talk back to it as if it were a person like yourself.</blockquote><blockquote>Bad people react to this by getting angry at the gate attendant; good people walk away stewing with thwarted rage.</blockquote>]]></content>

It depends on the complexity of the new feature, and the extendibility of the codebase. You have to use your best judgment. If it seems like a feature requires significant changes to existing modules, I’d lean on traditional development. However, if you see a gentle path to implementing this new feature, you might reap more benefits with TDD.</blockquote><blockquote>Greenfield development is a big no-no for TDD (at first). I don’t care how confident you are in what your interfaces will be. You’re not that good. Everything you think you know will change in the exploratory phase of a new project as you code, and you’ll strain your sanity by rewriting tests over and over again. Don’t do this, no matter how much your TDD idol pontificates its benefits.</blockquote><blockquote>BuT iF yOuR’e ReWrItInG yOuR tEsTs So MuCh, YoU’rE nOt PrAcTiSiNg TdD pRoPeRlY.” I don’t wanna hear it.

Application code -- Fast changing, poorly specified code. You need to have a rapid development cycle, "discovering" what the customer wants. Your #1 job is pleasing the customer, as quickly, and as reliably, as possible.</blockquote><blockquote>2. Library code -- Slow changing, highly specified code. You have a long, conservative development cycle. Your #1 job is supporting application programmers.</blockquote><blockquote>TDD probably works for #2, less so for #1. Furthermore, we all dream of being library developers (that our code and specifications are stable, and that our code can last decades). Alas, most of us are Application developers, and the lifespan of our code isn't really that long.</blockquote><blockquote>Recognizing the lifespan of your code, as well as the innate goals of your team (quick and dirty application style, or slow and careful library style) is important.
</blockquote><blockquote>...[Another comment with: A counterpoint to above.]...

I think this distinction is harmful. Your application code should include areas that function as "library code." We do this at work with an explicit UI library that we package separately, but there's no reason it needs to be packaged separately, just create directories that represent some library-esque element of your application and heavily test it and write docs for it, like you would a library.</blockquote>]]></content>

Its labour force is also shifting in that direction. Young people that graduate with college degrees don’t want to work hard hours in factories. They want white collar jobs. As such, China is also shifting out of low end manufacturing due to necessity of human capital.</blockquote>]]></content>

Most people think of a story as some stuff happened over the course of time and now I'm going to tell you about that usually chronologically and that will amount to a story and that really is just reporting on your life and no one actually wants you to report on your life. You know, other than maybe your mother and your spouse might be required to listen. It's just a simple accounting of your day or your week or your month and that's not interesting and it's not a story. So a story is about change over time. Usually it's sort of a realization like - I used to think one thing and now I think another thing  - that's story. Most stories are transformational, meaning I once was one kind of person then some stuff happened and now I'm actually an authentically different kind of person.</blockquote><p>The surprising boom of nose jobs in Iran.</p><blockquote>All of the women in Iranian model Azadeh's family have had nose surgeries, each feeling the pressure to conform with Western beauty standards in a country where female bodies are heavily policed.</blockquote><blockquote>To Ms. Azadeh, smoothing out the bump in what Iranians would call the "Persian nose" she was born with proved a lucrative investment.</blockquote><blockquote>Since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iranian women have been required to dress modestly and cover their hair, and the beauty industry has become almost entirely centred on the face.</blockquote><blockquote>"After the operation, not only have I earned myself a modelling job with better social standing but I'm also earning three times more and I'm more respected by clients," she said.</blockquote>]]></content>

It’s a young face, of course, with poreless skin and plump, high cheekbones. It has catlike eyes and long, cartoonish lashes; it has a small, neat nose and full, lush lips. It looks at you coyly but blankly, as if its owner has taken half a Klonopin and is considering asking you for a private-jet ride to Coachella.”</blockquote><blockquote>The look that Tolentino is describing is the result of (at least) three conspiring trends. The growing market for injectable treatments is driving a trend for physical enhancements. The rise of apps such as FaceTune is driving a trend for digital enhancements. And make-up techniques such as “strobing” and “contouring” are driving a trend for cosmetic enhancements. Over the last decade, these trends have developed in parallel, each feeding and fueling the other.</blockquote>]]></content>

It's the upper echelon which thinks that AI will replace the jobs, and that's enough to the replace jobs. Just like Return to office mandate.</p><blockquote>"decision-makers can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent" - Very correct. Whether or not AI actually comes for your job, the fact that enough people at the top think so is enough to cause trouble.</blockquote>]]></content>

I wish I could see a way out of the endless hype cycles that continue to elicit little more than cynicism from me. The version of technology that we’re mostly being sold today has almost nothing to do with improving lives, but instead stuffing the pockets of those who already need for nothing. It’s not making us smarter. It’s not helping heal a damaged planet. It’s not making us happier or more generous towards each other. And it’s entrenched in everything — meaning a momentous challenge to re-wire or meticulously disconnect. I’m slowly finding my own ways of breaking free to regain a sense of self and purpose. I’ve felt adrift the last few weeks and hopefully some planned activities this weekend will help guide me back to shore. I also tend to be a bit morose around my birthday so it might just be that.</blockquote>]]></content>

It’s hard to really relax and enjoy the present moment if we’re worried about getting our basic needs met. But there’s no sense in spending one’s entire life preparing and strategizing at the expense of actually living any of it. So obviously the solution is to cycle between the two phases, inhale and exhale, yin and yang. </blockquote>]]></content>

I built this site as a quick test if a time boxed social media experience feels better than an endless one.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>AI and bagels!</h2><p>Source: <a href="https://desystemize.substack.com/p/if-youre-so-smart-why-cant-you-die?publication">desystemize.substack.com</a></p><p>Tags: tech</p><p>Colin has an interesting perspective on when and how intelligence in AI can be defined.</p><blockquote>When a coffee shop makes a bagel, it’s a pretty good bet they can make a croissant as well. Not every shop that has one has the other, but they’re pretty strongly correlated. We call this correlation “baking”.

This sounds like a weird way to say it. We call “this correlation” baking? It just…is baking, isn’t it? But the steps you follow aren’t literally the exact same. The procedure to make a bagel and the procedure to make a croissant happen to be similar enough, achieving similar enough ends, of interest to similar enough people, that those similarities can be compactly described by the one word “baking”. But there’s nothing special about the word “baking” uniting these on any fundamental level. The similarities came first, and the word after.

Now imagine a coffee shop that’s been tasked to “achieve superbaking”. They make one bagel on Monday, ten bagels on Tuesday, and eighty million bagels on Wednesday. They’ve never made a croissant. Have they achieved superbaking?    </blockquote><p>Now comparing it with 'intelligence' in AI.</p><blockquote>What I’m contending here is that the word “intelligence” is like the word “baking” and it’s long past time we actually sit down and sort the bagels from the croissants. I am strongly against arguments of the form “Oh, it’s just parroting the data set - it’s not really thinking.” AI does a lot of things that we call “thinking” when we do them slower and worse. The fact it can also do those things should make us humble and curious, not proud and dismissive. But I think it’s equally silly to lump all these capacities together into “intelligence” and say “Intelligence is going up, so soon it will do everything intelligence can do.” You need to see some croissants before you conclude it’s actually baking and not just bageling.</blockquote>]]></content>
